### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The client has been re-written as a wrapper around [access-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-storage/access) and [upload-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-storage/upload-client) and the API has changed. 
 
Migration notes:

* `client.account()` has been removed, use `client.currentSpace()`
* `client.exportDelegation()` has been removed, use `client.createDelegation()` and then call `export()` on the returned value and encode the returned blocks as a CAR file using the [`@ipld/car`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ipld/car) library.
* `client.identity()` has been removed, use `client.agent()` + `client.currentSpace()` + `client.delegations()`
* `client.importDelegation()` has been removed, use `client.addProof()` (for general delegations to your agent) or `client.addSpace()` (to add a proof and _also_ add the space to your list of spaces).
* `client.insights()` has been removed - this was never working
* `client.invoke()` has been removed
* `client.list()` has been removed, use `client.capability.upload.list()`
* `client.makeDelegation()` has been renamed and signature has changed, use `client.createDelegation()`
* `client.register()` has been removed, use `client.registerSpace()`
* `client.remove()` has been removed, use `client.capability.store.remove()`
* `client.removeUpload()` has been removed, use `client.capability.upload.remove()`
* `client.stat()` has been removed, use `client.capability.store.list()`
* `client.upload()` has been removed, use `client.capability.store.add()`
* `client.uploadAdd()` has been removed, use `client.capability.upload.add()`
* `client.whoami()` has been removed, use `client.capability.space.info()`
